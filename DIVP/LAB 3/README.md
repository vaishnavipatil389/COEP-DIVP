**Task 1: Noise Suppression Using Averaging Filter**

As the kernel size increases, the averaging filter smooths the image more strongly.

3×3: Less noise reduction, but edges and fine details are mostly preserved.
5×5: Gives better noise suppression, but some edges/details become slightly blurred.
9×9: Removes the most noise, but causes the greatest loss of edges and fine details.

Trade-off: A larger kernel gives better noise reduction but more edge/detail loss. Therefore, the kernel size should be chosen to balance smoothness and image sharpness.

**Task 2 — Boundary Recovery via Laplacian Sharpening**

The 8-neighbor Laplacian recovers the obstacle edges more effectively in this image. The 4-neighbor Laplacian is sensitive mainly to intensity changes in the horizontal and vertical directions, while the 8-neighbor Laplacian also considers diagonal neighbors. Therefore, the 8-neighbor kernel detects edges in more directions and produces stronger, more complete boundary responses.

The Laplacian response is added to the motion-blurred image to enhance edges:

Sharpened Image=Blurred Image+Laplacian Response

**Task 3 — Unsharp Masking / High-Boost Design**

For each value:

k = 1 → Unsharp masking
k = 1.5 → Moderate sharpening
k = 2 → Strong sharpening
k = 3 → Very strong sharpening

As k increases:
Sharpening increases → but noise also gets amplified.
